# AgriCredit
AGRI-CREDIT is a service whose primary focus is aimed to estimate the right amount of money a farmer requires to invest and harvest in his crops and help banks disperse loans of the right amount so that the farmer benefits from the loan and also has the capacity to repay it in the stipulated time even if there is a crop failure or damage due to miscellaneous causes. The goal of AGRI-CREDIT is to ensure banks do not undergo losses due to no repayment of the loans provided and to give more monetary security to the farmers without the impeding fear and burden of high loan repayments at difficult times which in the recent past has lead farmers to consider drastic measures which are very disheartening. AGRI-CREDIT is a simple to use service which is provided to banks on a yearly subscription, the service provides deep insights by analysing the crop patterns, weather, time of harvest and other relevant data and suggests an estimate which can be considered to be known as a safe loan.
